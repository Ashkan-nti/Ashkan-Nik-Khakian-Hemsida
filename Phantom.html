                The outside may cast a familiar decades-old silhouette, but the Phantom's interior is packed with modern conveniences and 
                high-tech features to accompany its truly sumptuous environs. A V-12 engine provides seemingly endless power, yet it purrs 
                silently under the Phantom's long hood so as not to disturb the interior's restful ambience. Fine leathers, real wood, and 
                genuine metal parts cover every square inch of the cabin, and those relegated to the rear seat can relax in utmost comfort, 
                especially in the long-wheelbase Extended model.
